0.2.1

 * Updated .toc for 4.2
 * Calling it beta ready

0.2 Full functionality, needs more testing

 * supports every default raid frame mode
 * Auto-detection of raid frames and how they're sorted
 * keybindings in config panel
 * Only prints raid-changed-in-combat message once per combat, and prints message when out of combat and it's fixed
 * Only does this when a change actually affected a keybinding
 * The buttons not bound to used raid IDs are bound to unused raid IDs so that *some* button will target a raid member even during the rest of a combat they were added during
 * Code reorganization

0.1 Initial upload; if it's not too buggy it will provide very basic functionality for the two people I know of who would use this addon

 * Keybindings in blizzard keybinding interface
 * Two options for sorting; compatible with basic by-group displays of grid and blizzard raid panel
